# About #

This mode is derived from the [original php-mode for
emacs](http://php-mode.sourceforge.net/). Several other people on
github have forks with various enhancements to the original. I am
building on these, and adding improvements of my own in order to fix
various bugs, as well as bring the mode up to date with new versions
of PHP.

Recent improvements include:

* support for traits (PHP 5.4+)
* support for namespaces (PHP 5.3+)
* support for namespace aliases (PHP 5.3+)
* support for anonymous functions (PHP 5.3+)

# Installation #

To install, you can clone this repo into a directory of your choice (I
use ~/.emacs.d/php-mode).

Then add something like this to your .emacs configuration:

    (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/php-mode"))
    (require 'php-mode)

And you're off to the races!

# Bug Fixes & Other Improvements #

You can report any problems that you find on github's integrated issue
tracker. If you've added some improvements and you want them included
upstream don't hesitate to send me a patch or, even better, a GitHub
pull request.
